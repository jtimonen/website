# Introduction

## Recap of Part 1
We pick up from where we left off in [Part 1](https://jtimonen.github.io/posts/post-01/). We found out that CmdStan calls the Stan services in `cmdstan::command()`. For example with the command-line call
```bash
mymodel.exe id=1 method=sample algorithm=hmc engine=nuts adapt engaged=1
```

1. the called service is `stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_adapt()`
2. which then calls `stan::services::util::run_adaptive_sampler()`
3. which calls `stan::services::util::generate_transitions()`.

Note: All code pieces shown from now on in this post are adapted from [the stan source code](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan), licenced under the new BSD licence. Comments starting with `...` indicate parts that have been left out from original source code. During writing of this post, the most recent Stan version is 2.28.2. The hyperlinks to source code cannot be guaranteed to work in the future, if the source repo organization is changed or files are renamed.

## Starting point for Part 2

We find `generate_transitions()` in [generate_transitions.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/services/util/generate_transitions.hpp).

```cpp
void generate_transitions(stan::mcmc::base_mcmc& sampler, int num_iterations,
                          ..., stan::mcmc::sample& init_s, Model& model, ...) {
  for (int m = 0; m < num_iterations; ++m) {
    // ... callbacks and progress printing
    init_s = sampler.transition(init_s, logger);
    // ... writing to output
  }
}
```

Among other things, it takes as input the sampler, model, and initial point in parameter space. The function is basically just a loop that calls 
`sampler.transition()` repeatedly for `num_iterations` times. Therefore, all interesting algorithmic code and properties that define how sampling works, 
whether adaptation is performed etc, have to be included as part of `sampler`.

This is why we now jump from the `stan::services` namespace to `stan::mcmc`, 
where the different samplers and their transitions are defined.

# Samplers

We see in `generate_transitions()` that `sampler` has to have type `base_mcmc`. However, in `stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt()`,
our sampler was declared as

```cpp
stan::mcmc::adapt_diag_e_nuts<Model, boost::ecuyer1988> sampler(model, rng);
```

so what is going on?

<center><img src="sampler_class_inheritance.png" alt="Sampler Classes" width=790></center>

It appears that `adapt_diag_e_nuts` is a (templated) class that 
[derives](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/derived_class) from 
`base_mcmc` through multiple levels of inheritance, as can be seen from the above diagram.

## base_mcmc

This is just an [interface](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class) for all MCMC samplers, as it doesn't contain any function bodies.

```cpp
class base_mcmc {
 public:
  base_mcmc() {}

  virtual ~base_mcmc() {}

  virtual sample transition(sample& init_sample, callbacks::logger& logger) = 0;

  virtual void get_sampler_param_names(std::vector<std::string>& names) {}

  virtual void get_sampler_params(std::vector<double>& values) {}

  //... other virtual functions without body

};
```

The class member functions are all *virtual* (except the constructor), 
meaning that deriving classes can override them. We see that `transition()`
is *pure virtual* (declared with = 0), meaning that a deriving class 
*must* override it in order to be instantiable.



## base_hmc

This is a base for all Hamiltonian samplers, and derives from `base_mcmc`.

```cpp
template <class Model, template <class, class> class Hamiltonian,
          template <class> class Integrator, class BaseRNG>
class base_hmc : public base_mcmc {
 public:
  base_hmc(const Model& model, BaseRNG& rng)
      : base_mcmc(),
        z_(model.num_params_r()),
        integrator_(),
        hamiltonian_(model),
        rand_int_(rng),
        rand_uniform_(rand_int_),
        nom_epsilon_(0.1),
        epsilon_(nom_epsilon_),
        epsilon_jitter_(0.0) {}

  // ...

  void seed(const Eigen::VectorXd& q) { z_.q = q; }

  void init_hamiltonian(callbacks::logger& logger) {
    this->hamiltonian_.init(this->z_, logger);
  }

  void init_stepsize(callbacks::logger& logger) {
    ps_point z_init(this->z_);

    // Skip initialization for extreme step sizes
    if (this->nom_epsilon_ == 0 || this->nom_epsilon_ > 1e7
        || std::isnan(this->nom_epsilon_))
      return;

    this->hamiltonian_.sample_p(this->z_, this->rand_int_);
    this->hamiltonian_.init(this->z_, logger);

    // Guaranteed to be finite if randomly initialized
    double H0 = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);

    this->integrator_.evolve(this->z_, this->hamiltonian_, this->nom_epsilon_,
                             logger);

    double h = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
    if (std::isnan(h))
      h = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

    double delta_H = H0 - h;

    int direction = delta_H > std::log(0.8) ? 1 : -1;

    while (1) {
      this->z_.ps_point::operator=(z_init);

      this->hamiltonian_.sample_p(this->z_, this->rand_int_);
      this->hamiltonian_.init(this->z_, logger);

      double H0 = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);

      this->integrator_.evolve(this->z_, this->hamiltonian_, this->nom_epsilon_,
                               logger);

      double h = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
      if (std::isnan(h))
        h = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

      double delta_H = H0 - h;

      if ((direction == 1) && !(delta_H > std::log(0.8)))
        break;
      else if ((direction == -1) && !(delta_H < std::log(0.8)))
        break;
      else
        this->nom_epsilon_ = direction == 1 ? 2.0 * this->nom_epsilon_
                                            : 0.5 * this->nom_epsilon_;

      if (this->nom_epsilon_ > 1e7)
        throw std::runtime_error(
            "Posterior is improper. "
            "Please check your model.");
      if (this->nom_epsilon_ == 0)
        throw std::runtime_error(
            "No acceptably small step size could "
            "be found. Perhaps the posterior is "
            "not continuous?");
    }

    this->z_.ps_point::operator=(z_init);
  }

  // ...

  typename Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG>::PointType& z() { return z_; }

  const typename Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG>::PointType& z() const noexcept {
    return z_;
  }

  // ... setters and getters for the protected properties

  void sample_stepsize() {
    this->epsilon_ = this->nom_epsilon_;
    if (this->epsilon_jitter_)
      this->epsilon_
          *= 1.0 + this->epsilon_jitter_ * (2.0 * this->rand_uniform_() - 1.0);
  }

 protected:
  typename Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG>::PointType z_;
  Integrator<Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG> > integrator_;
  Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG> hamiltonian_;

  BaseRNG& rand_int_;

  // Uniform(0, 1) RNG
  boost::uniform_01<BaseRNG&> rand_uniform_;

  double nom_epsilon_;
  double epsilon_;
  double epsilon_jitter_;
};
```

We see that the class doesn’t implement `transition()`, so it is also an abstract class. What it does do is it defines some attributes that all Hamiltonian samplers need.

### class attributes

The attributes listed as protected describe the internal state of the sampler. All Hamiltonian samplers have these attributes, and the most interesting ones of them are

* `z_`: current state of the sampler (point in parameter space)
* `integrator_`: numerical integrator used to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics
* `hamiltonian_`: the Hamiltonian system
* `epsilon_` / `nom_epsilon_`: step size of the integrator

### getters

The above are private attributes and should not be directly [accessed](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/access)
from the outside. Instead, there are some getter methods that can be used, 
for example

```cpp
  typename Hamiltonian<Model, BaseRNG>::PointType& z() { return z_; }
```

so one could use `sampler.z()` to get the current point in the (unconstrained) parameter space.

### init_stepsize()

The first actual algorithm that we encouter is the `init_stepsize()` method
of the `base_hmc` class, defined in [base_hmc.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/hmc/base_hmc.hpp). This defines how the integrator's initial stepsize (possibly given by user) is refined. As we saw in Part 1, this gets called in `stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt()` before any MCMC iterations are done.

```cpp
void init_stepsize(callbacks::logger& logger) {
    ps_point z_init(this->z_);

    // Skip initialization for extreme step sizes
    if (this->nom_epsilon_ == 0 || this->nom_epsilon_ > 1e7
        || std::isnan(this->nom_epsilon_))
      return;

    this->hamiltonian_.sample_p(this->z_, this->rand_int_);
    this->hamiltonian_.init(this->z_, logger);

    // Guaranteed to be finite if randomly initialized
    double H0 = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);

    this->integrator_.evolve(this->z_, this->hamiltonian_, this->nom_epsilon_,
                             logger);

    double h = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
    if (std::isnan(h))
      h = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

    double delta_H = H0 - h;

    int direction = delta_H > std::log(0.8) ? 1 : -1;

    while (1) {
      this->z_.ps_point::operator=(z_init);

      this->hamiltonian_.sample_p(this->z_, this->rand_int_);
      this->hamiltonian_.init(this->z_, logger);

      double H0 = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);

      this->integrator_.evolve(this->z_, this->hamiltonian_, this->nom_epsilon_,
                               logger);

      double h = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
      if (std::isnan(h))
        h = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();

      double delta_H = H0 - h;

      if ((direction == 1) && !(delta_H > std::log(0.8)))
        break;
      else if ((direction == -1) && !(delta_H < std::log(0.8)))
        break;
      else
        this->nom_epsilon_ = direction == 1 ? 2.0 * this->nom_epsilon_
                                            : 0.5 * this->nom_epsilon_;

      if (this->nom_epsilon_ > 1e7)
        throw std::runtime_error(
            "Posterior is improper. "
            "Please check your model.");
      if (this->nom_epsilon_ == 0)
        throw std::runtime_error(
            "No acceptably small step size could "
            "be found. Perhaps the posterior is "
            "not continuous?");
    }

    this->z_.ps_point::operator=(z_init);
  }
```

On the lines

```cpp
    double H0 = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
    this->integrator_.evolve(this->z_, this->hamiltonian_, this->nom_epsilon_,logger);
    double h = this->hamiltonian_.H(this->z_);
    double delta_H = H0 - h;
```

the Hamiltonian is first computed at the current point `z_`, then the integrator evolves the state, after which the Hamiltonian is computed at the new state. The change in Hamiltonian (`delta_H`) then determines how the nominal stepsize (`nom_epsilon_`) is refined, or if it is suitable so that the actual MCMC 
sampling can start.

## base_nuts

This is defined in [base_nuts.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/hmc/nuts/base_nuts.hpp), and is the base class for No-U-Turn samplers with multinomial sampling. This class, which derives from `base_hmc`, is the first place where we encounter an implementation of `transition()`. You can read the comments in the source code of the `transition()` method to get and idea of the progress of the algorithm. We won’t go into details of the NUTS algorithm here, but just notice that the `transition()` function takes as input a `sample& init_sample` and generates a new `sample` object and returns it. Here, sample is a class that describes one MCMC draw, and it is defined in [sample.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/sample.hpp).

## diag_e_nuts

This is a base class for NUTS with the diagonal HMC metric (diagonal mass matrix), and derives from `base_nuts`. There are similar classes for the dense and unit metric too. There are no new methods here.

## adapt_diag_e_nuts

Finally we get to the class the defines the adaptive NUTS sampler with the diagonal metric. This class, `adapt_diag_e_nuts`, derives from `diag_e_nuts`. It overrides the `transition()` method with

```cpp
sample transition(sample& init_sample, callbacks::logger& logger) {
    sample s = diag_e_nuts<Model, BaseRNG>::transition(init_sample, logger);

    if (this->adapt_flag_) {
      this->stepsize_adaptation_.learn_stepsize(this->nom_epsilon_,
                                                s.accept_stat());

      bool update = this->var_adaptation_.learn_variance(this->z_.inv_e_metric_,
                                                         this->z_.q);

      if (update) {
        this->init_stepsize(logger);

        this->stepsize_adaptation_.set_mu(log(10 * this->nom_epsilon_));
        this->stepsize_adaptation_.restart();
      }
    }
    return s;
  }
```

The actual transition

```cpp
sample s = diag_e_nuts<Model, BaseRNG>::transition(init_sample, logger);
```

is still performed by calling the implementation of the parent class. This is the implementation defined in `base_nuts`, because `diag_e_nuts` does not override it.
The other code is for adapting the HMC metric and the integrator step size. To study how this work, we need to find out what `stepsize_adaptation_` and `var_adaptation_` are. However, we can’t seem to find them in `adapt_diag_e_nuts.hpp`. So what is again going on?

# Adaptation

We find that in addition to `diag_e_nuts`, the `adapt_diag_e_nuts` class derives also from another class, called `stepsize_var_adapter` (defined in [stepsize_var_adapter.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/stepsize_var_adapter.hpp)).

## Class hierarchy


<center><img src="adaptation.png" alt="Adaptation Classes" width=790></center>

The above diagram explains why sampler objects of class `adapt_diag_e_nuts`
have the `stepsize_adaptation_` and `var_adaptation_ attributes`.
The former is for adapting the integrator step size and the latter for adapting the mass matrix diagonal. The metric is adapted in three [windows](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/windowed_adaptation.hpp), which are called *init_buffer*, *term_buffer* and *base_window*. The the most abstract base class is [base_adaptation](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/base_adaptation.hpp),
which doesn’t contain any implemented methods.


## Algorithms

Let’s now return to studying the `transition()` method of the `adapt_diag_e_nuts`
class. When the `adapt_flag_` is on (that is, in the warmup phase), each transition will run the code

```cpp
  this->stepsize_adaptation_.learn_stepsize(this->nom_epsilon_,
                                                s.accept_stat());

  bool update = this->var_adaptation_.learn_variance(this->z_.inv_e_metric_,
                                                         this->z_.q);

  if (update) {
    this->init_stepsize(logger);

    this->stepsize_adaptation_.set_mu(log(10 * this->nom_epsilon_));
    this->stepsize_adaptation_.restart();
  }
```

### learn_stepsize()

The `learn_stepsize()` algorithm is defined in `stepsize_adaptation.hpp`.

```cpp
void learn_stepsize(double& epsilon, double adapt_stat) {
    ++counter_;

    adapt_stat = adapt_stat > 1 ? 1 : adapt_stat;

    // Nesterov Dual-Averaging of log(epsilon)
    const double eta = 1.0 / (counter_ + t0_);

    s_bar_ = (1.0 - eta) * s_bar_ + eta * (delta_ - adapt_stat);

    const double x = mu_ - s_bar_ * std::sqrt(counter_) / gamma_;
    const double x_eta = std::pow(counter_, -kappa_);

    x_bar_ = (1.0 - x_eta) * x_bar_ + x_eta * x;

    epsilon = std::exp(x);
  }
```

### learn_variance()

The `learn_variance()` algorithm on the other hand is defined in 
[var_adaptation.hpp](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/blob/develop/src/stan/mcmc/var_adaptation.hpp)

```cpp
bool learn_variance(Eigen::VectorXd& var, const Eigen::VectorXd& q) {
    if (adaptation_window())
      estimator_.add_sample(q);

    if (end_adaptation_window()) {
      compute_next_window();

      estimator_.sample_variance(var);

      double n = static_cast<double>(estimator_.num_samples());
      var = (n / (n + 5.0)) * var
            + 1e-3 * (5.0 / (n + 5.0)) * Eigen::VectorXd::Ones(var.size());

      if (!var.allFinite())
        throw std::runtime_error(...);

      estimator_.restart();

      ++adapt_window_counter_;
      return true;
    }

    ++adapt_window_counter_;
    return false;
  }
```

The interesting thing about this is that it returns `true` at the end of the three adaptation windows, and otherwise `false`. This return value (`update`)
determines what happens at the end of the transition.

### update

```cpp
  if (update) {
    this->init_stepsize(logger);

    this->stepsize_adaptation_.set_mu(log(10 * this->nom_epsilon_));
    this->stepsize_adaptation_.restart();
  }
```

This part is again an interesting algorithmic detail of the adaptation. We see that at the end of each window of metric adaptation, the stepsize adaptation is restarted from 10 times the average stepsize from the previous window. See [this thread](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/issue-with-dual-averaging/5995) for some motivation, discussion, and potential problems caused by this approach.

# Conclusion

* In this post we looked at the hierarchy of sampler and adaptation classes in Stan. These are all part of the `stan::mcmc` namespace, and are needed by the services (`stan::services`).
* The algorithmic details of a sampler are defined by its `transition`. We did not study the algorithms in detail, but mainly how the code is organized and where to find the implementations of the algorithms.
* For HMC samplers, one part of the algorithm is always `init_stepsize()`, which initializes the stepsize of the leapfrog integrator before any MCMC transitions.
* In this post, we did not go into the details of the [Hamiltonians](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/tree/develop/src/stan/mcmc/hmc/hamiltonians) and [integrators](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/tree/develop/src/stan/mcmc/hmc/integrators). These have a key role in the NUTS transition, and the details
can be studied in the linked source code.
